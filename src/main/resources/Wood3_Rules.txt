  Rules
This game is a two-player card game which is played in two phases: the Draft phase and the Battle phase.

    During the Draft phase, both players must create a deck of 30 cards.
    Once the Draft phase is over, both decks are shuffled.
    During the Battle, the board is divided in two parts: each player plays cards from their hand on their side of the board.
    To reduce the health points of an opponent, the player must make use of cards to deal damage.

  Draft Phase

    For 30 turns, both players are given a choice between 3 different cards. Players select the card they want to add to their deck by using the PICK command followed by 0, 1 or 2.
    By default, the PASS command will pick the first card.
    Both players can select the same card, they will each receive a copy.

  Battle Phase

Card Draw

    First player starts with 4 cards in hand whereas the second player starts with 5.
    Each turn, the active player draws one additional card from their deck.
    Both players possess runes which have an impact on card draw. However, runes should be ignored until the Bronze league.


Mana

    Mana is necessary to play cards.
    Both players start with 1 max mana.
    Each turn, the active player is granted one additional max mana, unless they already have 12 max mana.
    Each player can spend as much mana per turn as they have max mana.

  Card Types
In this league, there is only one type of card: Creatures.

Creatures

    Placing a creature card from the hand to the board is called summoning. A player summons creatures on their side of the board. They are used to attack the opponent and also serve as a defense against the creatures of the opposing player.
    Creatures have a cost in mana, attack points and defense points.
    By default, creatures can't attack the turn they are summoned. They can attack once per turn only.
    When a creature attacks another one, they both deal damage equals to their attack to the defense of the other creature. When a creature attacks the opponent, it deals damage equals to its attack to the HP of the opponent.
    Creatures are removed from play when their defense reaches 0 or less.
